title: User login system
---

<div style="text-align: justify;">
<p>These days, I've been working in a project called user login system made included in the course "Learn NodeJS by Building 10 Projects".</p>

<p>In that course, we have been introduced to Mongo and we have used a lot of packages like passport, bcrypt or express. </p>

<p>The project is a simple login system made with jade templates. The templates included some forms which we validated them using ExpressValidator.</p>

<p>We have also worked in the user model creation and we have interacted with the database (mongodb). When the interaction was made, we were also able to display success or error messages depending on the result of the action that the user made.</p>

<p>Finally, we use bcrypt to save encrypted the password and finally we display or hide the tabs of the navbar depending if we were a user or not.</p>
