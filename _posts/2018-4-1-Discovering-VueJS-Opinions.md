title: Discovering Vue.js. Opinions?
---

<div style="text-align: justify;">
<p>It has been a long time since my last post, but I was focused on university tasks. However, now in one of the subjects I "should" start studying jQuery. I know a bit about jQuery, so I don't want to lose my time and I have decided to study Vue.js basics.</p>

<p>To achieve that, I'm doing a course called "Vue JS 2.0 - Mastering Web Apps" in Udemy. Right now, I have covered the most basic stuff of Vue JS like directives, components or computed properties and the following image is a first app created in that course called Notemaster.</p>

<p>The next sections of that course consists of a series of applications which I hope I can learn a lot developing them.</p>

<p>So, the reason of this post is to ask you about your experience and opinion about Vue.js.</p>
